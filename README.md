## Rules

Sudoku is a puzzle game played on a 9x9 grid, divided into nine 3x3 subgrids.  
The objective is to fill every cell in the grid with a number from 1 to 9, while ensuring that each row and column contains unique numbers.  
In other words, no duplicate numbers can appear in any row or column. The puzzle may initially provide some numbers as clues, and the challenge is to logically deduce the correct placement of the remaining numbers to complete the grid.
