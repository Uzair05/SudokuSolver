# Cannibals and Missionary Problem

This project aims to solve the toy problem utilizing fundamental AI implementations.
The objective of this project was to demonstrate proficiency and expertise in utilizing the C++ STL.
## Rules

The problem involves three cannibals and three missionaries initially positioned on the left side of the river, and a single boat.
It is essential to ensure that there are never more cannibals than missionaries on either side of the river.
The boat has a capacity to carry either one or two individuals.

For the purpose of this project, it is assumed that the boat cannot be abandoned, meaning that the presence of a cannibal on the boat does not result in the missionaries being outnumbered.
